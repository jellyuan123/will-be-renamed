This assignemnt implemented a naive bayesian classifier. After implementing basic
functions with the likelihood file, I calculated acceleration from the dataset
file to improve my findings significantly. I did this by calculating acceleration 
between each second, then creating bins and counting frequencies to get the 
likelihood for each group. This was all done in the accelBins file. 
Although it was difficult to test if the program was 100% working, 
it did give the correct solutions after much tweaking. 

I wish I could have improved on the handling of NaN values, as well as the
computation for the probability within the recursive function, which was pretty
shaky a lot of the time. I am glad that the classifier ended up working as 
intended though - I had an error with an incorrect upper limit on the range 
that caused hours of debugging....

Dependencies: numpy

I would like to apologize for submitting this assignment a little bit after the 
deadline. I went home for break and got very confused by the 3-hour time 
difference. This was a very difficult assignment for me, and I found it 
hard to start early - I had two other projects and a midterm due on Monday. 
I also had issues with WiFi while trying to work on this project, since I was 
in the airport and on a plane. If any leniency at all could be given, that 
would be really appreciated. Thank you!
