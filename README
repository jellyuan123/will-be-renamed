This assignemnt implemented a naive bayesian classifier. After implementing basic
functions with the likelihood file, I calculated acceleration from the dataset
file to improve my findings significantly. I did this by calculating acceleration 
between each second, then creating bins and counting frequencies to get the 
likelihood for each group. This was all done in the accelBins file. 
Although it was difficult to test if the program was 100% working, 
it did give the correct solutions after much tweaking. 

I wish I could have improved on the handling of NaN values, as well as the
computation for the probability within the recursive function, which was pretty
shaky a lot of the time. I am glad that the classifier ended up working as 
intended though - I had an error with an incorrect upper limit on the range 
that caused hours of debugging....
